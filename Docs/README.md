The `FaFiFotography-YegFood.txt` is a scrapped version of [this website](https://fafifotography.com/yegfood-happy-hour-daily-specials/).

All of the hard work of data collection was done by them!

We have **NOT** asked them if we can borrow their data but in the spirit of hacking, we're asking for forgiveness!

Please checkout their amazing website, they deserve all of the credit.

As we currently have no plan to go to market we will ever be making any money off of the use of this data, therefore if in the future we decide that we want to go to market in the spirit of fair use, we should **NOT** use this data and spend the time to curate our own!

FYI: I spent about `23 + 31 + 15 + 12 + 30 + 6 + 8` minutes to edit the csv file by hand.

Thats **125 minutes** of staring at a text editor, editing a csv file...

Also the last 8 minutes came from the errors that the `csvMonster.py` caught!
